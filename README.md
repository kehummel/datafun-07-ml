# datafun-07-ml
Employing supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model using all available data and use the resulting model (a "best-fit" straight line) to make predictions.

# Project Initiation
1) Created repository in GitHub.
2) Added README and .gitignore when repository initiated. 
3) Cloned repository to local machine. 
4) Created requirements.txt
5) git-add-commit-push set up and working
6) Created and activated .venv
7) Added scikitlearn to requirements text and re-installed requirements text 

# Starting the Project
After creating the title, author, and link to repo, list import statements.
